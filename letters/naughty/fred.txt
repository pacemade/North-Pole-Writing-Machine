Dear Fred,

You must be very excited that Christmas is coming. Are you looking forward to getting lots of fun toys?

Are you? Seriously? C'mon kid.

I've been watching you all year. You emptied your dad's $500 bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.
And you've been a very naughty kid.

I can forgive a lot but when you made a campfire in your parent's basement it was the last straw. If it were up to me, you'd get nothing. In fact, I'd take back that Furby I got you last year. But Mrs. Claus insisted that I bring you something on your list. So you're getting the Kaleidoscope. But I'm making sure it's from the defect pile.


Scratch that, I've just been informed that we no longer have any more Kaleidoscopes, looks like you get nothing!


As for the:

  - Meccano
  - Kaleidoscope
  - Kaleidoscope
  - Kaleidoscope
  - Pony
  - Lego

Better luck next year.

Remember â€“ I'll be watching you.

Regards,
Santa "All-seeing" Claus
